# Vehicle_ManeuverDetection_BehaviourAnalysis

This repo consists of my project work during my internship at TCS - AutoScape.

Detect Maneuvers (turn - right, left, right side U, left side U) and behavior of the vehicle (surges in speed, sudden breaks, etc).

Proposed 2 approaches for Detecting maneuvers:
- Comparing frames of images captured by car from different positions (front, back, left, and right)
- Analyzing readings from Magnetometer (angle) or GPS data.

For vehicle behavior:
Analyzed different parameters like linear velocity, angular velocity, roll, pitch, yaw, etc</br>
Then, Visualize this data and extract insights (any abnormal behavior?).
